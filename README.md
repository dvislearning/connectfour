# connectfour

Connect Four is an exercise in Test Driven Development using RSpec from [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/testing-ruby).  Specs were written first, allowed to fail, and then code was written to make the specs pass. 

Please run: ruby lib/game.rb from the terminal to play.
